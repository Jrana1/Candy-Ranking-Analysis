# ### Description and Objectives 
# + Lidl wants to expand its confectionery line but debates between a cookie-based or fruit gummy candy.
# + Market research was conducted to assess existing sweets popularity.
# + The task involves analyzing data to understand which candy traits drive popularity.
# + The goal is to recommend key characteristics for a successful new candy.

# ## Assumptions:
# + It's not clear if we prefer high or low sugar content in candies. High sugar can affect health, so knowing this would impact our choices.
# 
# + Since people in the survey didn't have to buy the candies, it seems like the price might not affect how well a candy does. But we should check more to be sure.
# 
# + We're not sure if the company wants candies with high or moderate win percentages. I assumed we aim for high win percentages because there are more candies with moderate wins.
# 
# + The data doesn't tell us which people we're targeting (like kids, young adults, or older people) or their ages. So, I assumed we're not focusing on any specific group for this analysis.

# **The Candy Power Ranking** dataset contains 9 categorical variables **(chocolate, fruity, caramel, peanutyalmondy, nougat, crispedricewafer, hard, bar, pluribus)**, 3 continuous variables **(sugarpercent, pricepercent, winpercent)**, and 1 nominal variable **competitorname**.

# + The dataset contains the following fields:
# 
#    + **chocolate**	Does it contain chocolate?
#    + **fruity**	Is it fruit flavored?
#    + **caramel**	Is there caramel in the candy?
#    + **peanutalmondy**	Does it contain peanuts, peanut butter or almonds?
#    + **nougat**	Does it contain nougat?
#    + **crispedricewafer**	Does it contain crisped rice, wafers, or a cookie component?
#    + **hard**	Is it a hard candy?
#    + **bar**	Is it a candy bar?
#    + **pluribus**	Is it one of many candies in a bag or box?
#    + **sugarpercent**	The percentile of sugar it falls under within the data set.
#    + **pricepercent**	The unit price percentile compared to the rest of the set.
#    + **winpercent**	The overall win percentage 

# For categorical variables, **0** signifies **does not contain that property**,' while **1** indicates **contains that property**

#    + The majority $(93.3\%)$ of the most popular candies feature **chocolate**, while only a small proportion $(6.6\%)$ include **fruity** flavors.
#    + None of these top-ranked candies belong to the category of **hard** candies.
#    + Approximately half $(53.33\%)$ of them are not Candy **bars**.
#    + Almost $(53.33\%)$ of the most popular candies contains **peanutyalmondy**.
#    + Between $15\%$ to $30\%$ of these candies contain **pluribus**, **nougat**, **caramel** and **crispedricewafer**, showing a relatively limited presence of these particular ingredients among the selection.
#    + Additionally, these popular candies exhibit characteristics of high **sugar conten**t and a tendency towards      **higher pricing**.

# In[16]:


visualize_most_least_popular_candies(df.sort_values(by="winpercent",ascending=True).iloc[:15,:],"least")


# ### Analysis of Bottom 15 Candies:
#  + Examining the least popular 15 candies reveals stark differences compared to the top 15 candies.
# 
#  + Only a small percentage (6.6%) of the least popular candies feature chocolate, while a majority (53%) incorporate fruity flavors.
# 
#  + The majority of these less favored candies do not fall under the category of hard candies. None of them are Candy bars.
# 
# + Moreover, almost none of them contains **nougat**, **peanutyalmondy**, and **crispedricewafer**.
# 
# + Interestingly, these less popular candies tend to have lower sugar content and are priced relatively lower.

# **In summary**, popular candies often feature **chocolate**, **peanutyalmondy** exclude **hard** candies, and lean towards Candy **bars**. They may include certain ingredients but tend to have higher sugar content and pricing. On the other hand, less popular candies commonly incorporate fruity flavors, fewer Candy bar variations, and generally have lower sugar content and pricing.

# Candies containing **chocolate** generally exhibit a slight trend of having more sugar compared to **fruity** candies. However, this difference in sugar content appears to have a minimal impact or influence.

# ## Findings:
#  + **Chocolate's the Favorite:**
# 
#    + People love candies with chocolate the most.
#  + **Other Yummy Stuff Matters Too:**
# 
#     + Ingredients like peanuts, nougat, crispy wafer, and caramel also make candies more likable.
#  + Sweet Candies are a Hit:
# 
#    + People really enjoy candies with lots of sugar in them.
#  + **Price Doesn't Change Much:**
# 
#     + How much candies cost didn't affect how much people liked them in the survey.Hence, my assumption is that the price doesn't impact the winpercent
#  + **Best Mix: Chocolate and Peanuts Rock:**
# 
#    + Candies with chocolate and peanuts were liked more than candies with chocolate, nougat, crispy wafer, and    caramel.
#  + **Making Chocolate and Peanut Mix Even Better:**
# 
#     +  Now, let's try adding nougat, crispy wafer, and caramel to chocolate and peanuts to make candies even  tastier!

# With an F-value of approximately 7.3118 and a p-value of approximately 0.0105, the analysis suggests that there is a significant difference in 'winpercent' between the groups based on the presence or absence of 'peanutyalmondy' in chocolates that contain chocolate. The p-value being less than 0.05 indicates that there is strong evidence to reject the null hypothesis, suggesting that the 'peanutyalmondy' ingredient does have a significant impact on the 'winpercent' within chocolates that contain chocolate.

# **In short**, candies with chocolate and peanutyalmondy (without caramel) achieve the highest winpercent. We'll examine if these candies significantly outperform others. Additionally, candies with chocolate and caramel (without peanut/almond) also perform remarkably well, significantly better than others. However, since there are only three candies with all three features, reaching statistical significance is not feasible, despite these being the most important features identified earlier.

# ## Utilize  machine learning models to gain deeper insights or a more comprehensive understanding.

# ### Data Preprocessing:

# Splitting into features and target variable

# In[ ]:


X = df[['chocolate', 'peanutyalmondy', 'crispedricewafer', 'nougat', 'caramel']] ## features
Y = df['winpercent'] # target variable


# 
# Given the absence of missing or duplicate values in our dataset, there's no immediate need for data cleaning procedures. Moreover, our categorical variables are already in a normalized form, which is advantageous. To enhance the accuracy of our model, we can apply the <code>StandardScaler</code> method specifically to the 'pricepercent' and 'sugarpercent' variables for scaling purposes.

# In[ ]:


from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler
scaler = StandardScaler()
X[['sugarpercent', 'pricepercent']] = scaler.fit_transform(X[['sugarpercent', 'pricepercent']])


# ### Split data into training and testing sets
#   I want to use $75\%$ data for training purpose and rest for the testing purpose.

# In[ ]:


from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
X_train, X_test, Y_train, Y_test = train_test_split(X,Y , test_size=0.25, random_state=42)


# In[ ]:


X_train.shape, X_test.shape


# ### Model Selection

# Our objective is not centered around predicting **winpercent**; instead, we aim to ascertain the significance of each variable in relation to **winpercent**. Given the presence of numerous categorical variables in our dataset, I intend to utilize the <code>LinearRegression</code> model as a starting point.

# ### fit the model

# In[ ]:


from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression
# Initializing and fitting Logistic Regression model
logreg = LinearRegression()
logreg.fit(X_train, Y_train)


# ### model evaluation

# In[ ]:


from sklearn.metrics import mean_squared_error, mean_absolute_error, r2_score

# Predicting on the test set
y_pred = logreg.predict(X_test)

# Calculating R-squared
r_squared = r2_score(Y_test, y_pred)

# Calculating MSE and RMSE
mse = mean_squared_error(Y_test, y_pred)

print(f"R-squared: {r_squared}")
print(f"Mean Squared Error (MSE): {mse}")


# + R-squared (RÂ² = 0.301):
# 
#    + The R-squared value measures the proportion of the variance in the dependent variable (target) that is predictable from the independent variables (features). In this case, around 30% of the variance in the target variable can be explained by the linear regression model. Higher values of R-squared closer to 1 indicate a better fit.
# +  Mean Squared Error (MSE = 136.65):
# 
#    + The MSE represents the average of the squared differences between predicted values and actual values. Here, the average squared difference between the predicted and actual values is approximately 136.65. Lower MSE values indicate a better fit.

# ### important features

# In[ ]:


feature_importance_df = pd.DataFrame({'Feature':X.columns
                                      , 'Importance': logreg.coef_})
feature_importance_df = feature_importance_df.sort_values(by='Importance', ascending=False)

sns.barplot(feature_importance_df['Feature'], feature_importance_df['Importance'],palette='crest')
plt.xlabel('Importance')
plt.title('Feature Importance in Random Forest Model')
plt.xticks(rotation=60)
plt.show()


# Here we can still see that **chocolate** has the most importance following with **sugarpercent**, **pricepercent** and **peanutyalmondy**

# The **MSE** and **R-squared** values indicate that our current model performance is suboptimal. One possible reason for this could be the predominant use of categorical independent variables. Due to their categorical nature, determining a linear relationship becomes challenging. To address this limitation, let's explore the efficacy of employing tree-based models.

# ## Summary

# The individual analysis indicates that **chocolate**, **peanutyalmondy**, **nougat**, **crispy wafer**,  and **caramel** emerge as the most influential features. Candies containing **chocolate** alongside either **peanutyalmondy** tend to be the top-performing ones.I haven't identified any additional ingredient that consistently contributes to high winpercent when paired with both **chocolate** and **peanutyalmondy**.
# 
# However, exploring these features together in multivariate analysis doesn't provide additional or more meaningful insights beyond what was revealed in the individual (univariate) analysis.

# ## Recommendation:
# Consider producing candies that include **chocolate** and **peanutyalmondy** ingredients, ideally with a moderate sugar content.
